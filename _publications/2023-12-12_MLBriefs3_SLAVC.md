excerpt: 'Mo and Morgado introduced in 2022 a novel self-supervised learning approach for Visual Sound
Source Localization, denoted as SLAVC [13]. The proposed method is based on multiple-
instance contrastive learning. In addition to improving the results of previous methods, it
also solves two critical problems that former methods faced: 1) excessive overfitting despite
training on extensive datasets, 2) tendency to hallucinate sound sources even when no visual
evidence to support it in the video. In this paper, we briefly present the method, offer an online
executable version allowing the users to test it on their own image-audio pairs and propose some
improvements that could benefit the model as future work.'
